# Recommendations-with-IBM-Watson

Helps to provide recommendations to IBM Watson users on the next articles the users can read on their platform. 
I analyzed the interactions that users had with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and made recommendations to them about new articles I think they would like. 

Below you can see an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Platform.

Though the above dashboard is just showing the newest articles, you could imagine having a recommendation board available here that shows the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user,I performed a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. You can create your own account to become a part of their community, and get a better understanding of their data by creating an account on the platform [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/).

## Project Motivation

This project is being done as a part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. It involves Rank based filtering, Collaborative filtering, and SVD models for recommendations.

## Libraries used:

1. [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## The Process:

The process has 5 steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Rank Based Recommendations
3. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
4. Matrix Factorization
5. Extras & Concluding

## Acknowledgements:

1. [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson) for providing us the data.
2. Udacity for giving the direction and scope of the project
